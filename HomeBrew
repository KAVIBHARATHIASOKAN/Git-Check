How to install Homebrew on macOS — step-by-step

Nice — here’s a short, safe, copy-pasteable guide that works for Intel Macs and Apple Silicon (M1/M2). I’ll include diagnostics, PATH steps, and a quick smoke test.

⸻

1) Open Terminal

Applications → Utilities → Terminal (or Spotlight ⌘+Space → “Terminal”).

⸻

2) Install Xcode Command Line Tools (required)

Run:

xcode-select --install

A dialog will appear — click Install. If they’re already installed you’ll get a message saying so.

⸻

3) Confirm your Mac CPU (Intel vs Apple Silicon)

Run:

uname -m

	•	arm64 → Apple Silicon (M1/M2)
	•	x86_64 → Intel

You need this so the correct Homebrew PATH is set after installation.

⸻

4) Run the official Homebrew installer (one line)

Copy & paste exactly:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

This clones Homebrew to the right location and does basic setup. During the install it may ask for your password to create directories.

The script will print the exact commands you need to add to your shell profile — follow those printed instructions (next step also shows the common ones).

⸻

5) Add Homebrew to your shell environment (if the installer doesn’t auto-add)

After install, run the command appropriate for your CPU type.

Apple Silicon (arm64, default path /opt/homebrew)

echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

Intel (x86_64, default path /usr/local)

echo 'eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"

If you use bash or you prefer ~/.zshrc, you can add the same eval line there. On macOS with zsh, ~/.zprofile is preferred for login shells.

⸻

6) Verify installation

Check version and run a quick health check:

brew --version
brew update
brew doctor

brew --version should print a version. brew doctor will say Your system is ready to brew. (or point out recommended fixes).

⸻

7) Optional: disable analytics

If you want to turn off Homebrew analytics:

brew analytics off


⸻

8) Quick test: install something tiny

Install wget to confirm brew installs packages:

brew install wget
wget --version


⸻

9) Uninstall (if you change your mind)

To completely remove Homebrew later:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"


⸻

Troubleshooting (common issues)
	•	Permission errors on /usr/local (Intel): run sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/* only if necessary and if you understand the change. Prefer the installer messages first.
	•	brew not found after install: make sure you ran the eval "$(.../brew shellenv)" command and restarted your terminal.
	•	Installer asks for password: that’s your macOS user password (to create directories).
	•	Network blocked: if curl fails, ensure you have internet access and that curl is allowed by any firewall.

⸻

Short checklist (the minimum commands)

xcode-select --install
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
# then (for Apple Silicon)
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
# or (for Intel)
eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"
brew --version
brew doctor


⸻

If you’d like, I can:
	•	Give you the exact eval line to add based on your uname -m (paste the uname -m output here), or
	•	Walk you through installing a package (e.g., git or MesloLGS NF via Homebrew Cask) once brew is installed.
